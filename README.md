Code of the final project for the subject "Formal Languages and Compilers" at EAFIT university. This project is based on the algorithms to compute the First and Follow sets for nonterminal symbols in a context-free grammar.  

## Information
- The chosen language was Python.
- The program was executed on Windows OS.
- The IDE we used was Pycharm.
- Tool Python3.

## Instructions To Run The Program

Follow these instructions to run the program:

1. Install Python.

2. Download the main.py.

2. Go to the project directory where you stored main.py.

3. Run the main.py file:
    ```bash
    py main.py
    
    ```
4. Enter the number of grammars to process.

5. Enter the number of rules for the grammar.

6. Enter the production rules, for example.
     ```bash
    S AB
    A aA a
    B bBc bc
    ```
7. The program would return the "first" and "follow" result of the grammar.
